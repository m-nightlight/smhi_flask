# Railway Hobby Tier Deployment Guide

## ðŸš‚ Upgrading to Railway Hobby Tier

### What Changed:
- **No API URL changes needed** - Your endpoints remain the same
- **Higher resource limits** - More memory, CPU, and bandwidth
- **Better uptime** - Less likely to sleep/restart
- **Custom domains** - If you had one, it continues working

### âœ… What You Need to Do:

#### 1. **Deploy the Updated Code**
```bash
# Commit and push your changes
git add .
git commit -m "Update for Railway hobby tier"
git push
```

#### 2. **Verify Your Railway URL**
1. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Select your project
3. Go to **Settings** tab
4. Look for **Domains** section
5. Copy your URL (should look like: `https://your-app-name.railway.app`)

#### 3. **Test Your Deployment**
Run the test script I created:
```bash
python test_railway.py
```

**Important:** Update the `RAILWAY_URL` variable in `test_railway.py` with your actual Railway URL!

#### 4. **Check Railway Dashboard**
- Verify your service is running on **Hobby** tier
- Check the **Deployments** tab for successful builds
- Monitor **Metrics** for resource usage

### ðŸ”§ New Features Added:

#### **Health Check Endpoint**
- **URL:** `https://your-app.railway.app/`
- **Purpose:** Railway uses this to verify your app is healthy
- **Response:** JSON with status and timestamp

#### **Better Error Handling**
- Proper timeout handling for SMHI API calls
- Graceful fallbacks for missing data
- Railway-specific deployment info in responses

#### **Environment Configuration**
- Uses Railway's `PORT` environment variable
- Proper host binding for Railway infrastructure
- Production-ready settings (debug=False)

### ðŸ“Š Testing Your API:

#### **Health Check:**
```bash
curl https://your-app.railway.app/
```

#### **Weather Data:**
```bash
curl https://your-app.railway.app/data
```

### ðŸš¨ Troubleshooting:

#### **If API is not responding:**
1. Check Railway dashboard for deployment status
2. Look at **Logs** tab for error messages
3. Verify your code was pushed successfully
4. Check if Railway service is running

#### **If you get timeout errors:**
- Hobby tier has better performance than free tier
- Check SMHI API status (they might be slow)
- Verify your station ID is correct

#### **If you need to restart:**
1. Go to Railway dashboard
2. Click **Deployments**
3. Click **Redeploy** on latest deployment

### ðŸ’° Hobby Tier Benefits:

- **No sleep mode** - Your API stays awake
- **Higher limits** - More requests per minute
- **Better performance** - Faster response times
- **Custom domains** - Professional URLs
- **Priority support** - Better customer service

### ðŸ”„ Next Steps:

1. **Test your API** with the provided test script
2. **Update your iOS app** if you're using a different API URL
3. **Monitor performance** in Railway dashboard
4. **Set up alerts** if needed for downtime

### ðŸ“± iOS App Integration:

If your iOS app was using the old Railway URL, you might need to update it. The URL format should be:
```
https://your-app-name.railway.app/data
```

### ðŸŽ¯ Success Indicators:

- âœ… Health check returns `{"status": "healthy"}`
- âœ… `/data` endpoint returns weather data
- âœ… Railway dashboard shows "Deployed" status
- âœ… No timeout errors in logs
